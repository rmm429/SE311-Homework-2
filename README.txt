This project is a Keyword-in-Context (KWIC) searcher.
Part 1 involves using Java interfaces for the Pipe and Filter.
Part 2 involves using standard input/output (bash command line) for the Pipe and Filter.

Part 1:
	Open the "Part1" folder in IntelliJ.
	run() is contained in Controller.java in the "se311" directory.

Part 2:
	Each subfolder is an individual component.
	If running in IntelliJ, open the folder of each component individually. ("input", "output", "search", etc.)
	run() is contained in the Java file named the same as each component. (Input.java, Output.java, Search.java, etc.)
	Do not open the "Part2" folder in IntelliJ, each individual folder has its own project structure.

There are also README files for each part in their respective folders.
